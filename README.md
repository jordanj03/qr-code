### What I learned

how to center a div lol

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<main>
  <div class="container"></div>
</main>
```

```css
main {
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.container {
  height: 250px;
  width: 250px;
  /* SUCCESS!! */
}
```
